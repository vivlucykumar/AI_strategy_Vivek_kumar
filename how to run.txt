RAG Application for Streamlit Cloud
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to be deployed seamlessly on Streamlit Cloud. It uses Google's Gemini API for the LLM and Cohere's API for the embedding model to ensure stability and reliability.

📝 Prerequisites
Google AI Studio API Key: Get a free API key from Google AI Studio. This key will be used for the Gemini LLM.

Cohere API Key: Sign up for a free account on Cohere and get your API key. This key will be used for the embedding model.

A GitHub repository for your project.

A local machine with Python 3.10+ and pip.

📂 Project Structure
Your final project directory should look like this:

/ai_strategy
├── .streamlit/
│   └── secrets.toml
├── data/
│   └── (your PDF files go here)
├── chroma_db/
│   └── (automatically generated by build_db.py)
├── chat_app.py
├── build_db.py
├── requirements.txt
├── strategy_rag.py
└── README.md

🛠️ Local Setup Steps
Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai_strategy.git
cd ai_strategy
python -m venv .venv
source venv\Scripts\activate

Create the .streamlit/secrets.toml file.

Create a new directory named .streamlit and a file named secrets.toml inside it. Add your API keys to this file. Do not commit this file to GitHub.

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_api_key_here"
COHERE_API_KEY = "your_cohere_api_key_here"

Install dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Add your PDF files.

Place all your strategic documents in the data/ folder.

Build the vector database.

Run the build_db.py script locally. This will process your PDFs and create the chroma_db folder. This folder needs to be committed and pushed to GitHub for Streamlit Cloud to use it.

python build_db.py

Run the app locally.

streamlit run chat_app.py

🚀 Deployment to Streamlit Cloud
Push your project to GitHub.

Ensure your chat_app.py, strategy_rag.py, build_db.py, requirements.txt, and the entire chroma_db folder are pushed to your GitHub repository. Do not push .streamlit/secrets.toml.

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud.

Go to your Streamlit dashboard and click New app.

Select your GitHub repository and the branch containing your code.

Before deploying, go to the Advanced settings section.

Add your Google API key and Cohere API key as secrets, using the exact same variable names: GOOGLE_API_KEY and COHERE_API_KEY.
